This project simulates a simplified web analytics system for a SaaS company with a sales-driven go-to-market strategy. It includes synthetic data generation, event tracking, summary statistics, and a basic modeling pipeline.


Core Components

Synthetic Data Generation: Simulates web user attributes and behaviors across funnel stages (top, middle, bottom).

Event Tracking: Collects and retains events with hourly granularity over a 24-hour window.

Statistics Engine: Computes views and demo counts, as well as moving averages by time or user segment.

Modeling: A basic logistic regression to identify attributes most predictive of demo requests.
